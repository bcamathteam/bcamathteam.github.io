                    math team in freshman year, he’s come to love the subject and community around it, especially 
                    the awesome trips he gets to go on! His main interests are physics, math, and computer science, 
                    but he also enjoys video games as well as writing and playing music. He hopes that the math 
                    team community can bring many pure-math fans into competition math as it did for him!

                    is so grateful to be part of this highly engaging and exciting community. His favorite experiences 
                    with the math team were at the World Math Team Championship, where he met people from all over the 
                    world, and argued extensively about whether Chinese or Korean food was the best. David’s other 
                    interests include debate, politics, history and music; when not at math team, David is involved in 
                    BCA’s debate and Model UN clubs. However, David suffers from a chronic Youtube addiction, and also 
                    struggles with narcissism, as he apparently only refers to himself in the third person. Nonetheless, 
                    he hopes that you enjoy being in the BCA Math Team, and that it fosters the same appreciation for

                    (which was where she met Yul!), and she has slowly gained an appreciation for competition 
                    math since then. Her favorite math team memory would definitely be the trip to the World Math 
                    Team Championships in Seoul, South Korea, where she formed stronger bonds with her fellow math 
                    team members and ate lots and lots of good food—a truly unforgettable experience. When she’s 
                    not doing math, she might be listening to/making music (her mediums are mainly voice and guitar), 
                    cooking and baking different things to eat, fencing, or (most likely) sleeping. BCA Math Team has 
                    become an irreplaceable part of her high school career, and she hopes that many will find their 
                    place in it too :).

                    playing cards, with her fellow math team members (some of whom became her best friends) such as going to 
                    Korea for the World Math Team Championships, Massachusetts for HMMT, and Pennsylvania for ARML. In her 
                    free time, she likes to listen to music (she has millions of Spotify playlists), waste a lot of time on 
                    her phone, or try to learn how to code. She believes that the BCA Math Team is one of the best communities

                    has been with the team for as long as she can remember.  She has attended competitions all over the world and 
                    summer programs all across the country for one sole purpose: math.  When she is not math-ing, you might find 
                    Jessica playing soccer, throwing a frisbee, making YouTube videos, fiddling with cards, speed cubing, or eating 
                    ice cream.  For her, the BCA Math Team has been a community of the most amazing people she has ever met, and

                    Lynn is a senior in AAST and has been involved in the BCA math team since middle school. A great memory from 
                    the math team was when she learned the most complicated card game from fellow math-teamers in the bus on the 
                    way to HMMT. In her free time, Lynn loves to participate in CTF competitions, listen to music, and create 
                    digital art. Through this team, she was able to cultivate both her knowledge and confidence in her math skills, 
                    and met many amazing, like-minded people. Her hope is that you are able to get as much from the math team as she did!

                    Hey! I’m a senior in ATCS. I’ve always thought that math was cool and always had fun learning and solving math 
                    problems! I’ve been going to math team since eighth grade and it was the place that I found a lot of my closest 
                    friends whom I can do and talk about math with. One of my favorite memories of math team was the trip we took 
                    to Korea for the WMTC, next to the weekly donuts I always enjoyed (so sad that they are gone because we are virtual 
                    now). In my free time I love cooking Korean food, playing tennis, and chilling out to some cool songs.

                    Hi. I’m Laurence. I’m in AAST. In fact, I’m a senior. Math team has been the most worthwhile experience. For real — 
                    one meets some of the best people here at BCA math team! Although only with the math team a short time, I encourage 
                    all to join and explore the possibilities you’ll have here. In my free time (which is surprisingly pretty abundant at 
                    BCA), you might catch me doing a whole League of things, here a bit of coding, reading, and maybe (on some tiny off-chance) 
                    sleeping!

                    include the World Mathematics Team Championship in Seoul, South Korea, and the HMMT. In his free time he enjoys compsci, 
                    playing tennis, or (most likely) wasting time on Youtube.
