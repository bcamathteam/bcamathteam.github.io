Hi all, 
We hope you had a great summer! Math team is starting up virtually with our first lectures next Saturday, 9/12. The following lectures will be held: 
Introduction to Algebra: In this lecture, we investigate logarithms in-depth and with motivation. We'll take a look at why logs are useful and derive the laws governing them. We further look at their applications in seemingly unrelated problems. 
Lecture by Vivian Tan and Jessica Lee. 

Intermediate Algebra: (Prerequisite: Log rules) In this lecture, we dig deeper into logarithms and consider their applications in competitions. We’ll also take a look at nested exponents and their applications in seemingly unrelated problems. 
Lecture by Simon Sun and Laurence Lu. 

Introduction to Number Theory: As we look ahead to the remainder of the COVID pandemic, in this lecture we will learn about one of the most foundational components in number theory: the remainder. We will discover and prove some of the important properties of remainders and how we can later apply them in various problems. If time allows, we can also look at some of the ways we can apply remainders to objects that aren't necessarily numbers! 
Lecture by Andy Jung and David Du. 

Intermediate Number Theory: (Prerequisite: Basic modular arithmetic) In this lecture, we will explore the applications of modular arithmetic to a variety of problems. We’ll look at the properties of units digits and how to find the units digits of numerical expressions quickly. Extending on the ideas of modular arithmetic, we will prove the divisibility rules for certain numbers and how to apply them. To finish off, after looking at inverses, we’ll prove both Fermat’s Little Theorem and possibly Wilson’s Theorem, after which we will explain how to apply them to problems in competitions. 
Lecture by Gregory Pylypovych. 

We look forward to seeing you soon!
