Hey everyone, we hope you are all staying safe and healthy in this stressful time period. Since this year's math contest season is effectively over due to the Coronavirus, we've decided to provide you with a sampling of "higher math" topics. This lecture marks the first in our new \(\textbf{Great Mathematicians}\) series. We'll be telling the stories of some of the most iconic mathematicians of all time, and along the way, we'll guide you through some of their results. You'd be surprised how much you can understand with a solid grasp of elementary math! Without further ado, let's begin the first installment with one of the most revolutionary mathematicians of the recent history, \(\textbf{Srinivasa Ramanujan}\).

\(\textbf{History}:\) Srinivasa Ramanujan was born to a modest Brahmin family on December 22, 1887 in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India. Erode is a small village a few hundred kilometers from the city Chennai. Early in his life, he moved to Kumbakonam, closer to Chennai, and it is in this town where his love for mathematical exploration began. As early as 1900, he began playing around with sums, later exploring the cubic and quartic formulae. In high school, he got his hands on a copy of G.S. Carr's "Synopsis of Pure Mathematics", a book that served as his "formal training" in mathematics. He borrowed the library loaned book from a friend, perusing its every detail. Although the book was years out of date, Ramanujan was able to teach himself a wide array of mathematical techniques from this text, it being his only source of higher mathematical knowledge.

By 1904, Ramanujan's real research began. Notably, he began rediscovering properties of the Bernoulli numbers. That same year, Ramanujan was awarded a scholarship to the Government College in Kumbakonam. However, he neglected his non-mathematical studies, falling into trouble and running away to the town of Vizagapatnam. He continued his research into hypergeometric series. After related attempts to receive admission into other colleges, Ramanujan was forced to set out on his own mathematical excursions. In 1911, he started to gain popularity in mathematical for his original papers in \(\textit{Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society}\). Soon enough, he was able to secure a small job as a clerk, providing him some sustenance as he pursued his independent research. Those around him failed to appreciate his work, and it was only in 1913 that he received real recognition from none other than the renowned English mathematician G.H. Hardy. In his letter, Ramanujan confessed that "I have not trodden through the conventional regular course... but I am striking out a new path for myself." Yet his letters contained stunning results, including Riemann series, elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and functional equations of the zeta function Indeed, Ramanujan's original work blew Hardy away, and within a few months, Hardy had brought Ramanujan over to Trinity College, Cambridge to being their legendary collaboration. Hardy, trained in the most elite mathematical institutions of modern England, pushed the boundaries of research with Ramanujan, a young Indian enthusiast who lacked any sort of formal training, balancing his need for rigor with Ramanujan's brilliant (and at times, bizarre) intuition. Ramanujan was recognized by numerous contemporaries in England, and his fame grew. He received his PhD from Cambridge and was a elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. Unfortunately, Ramanujan's health suffered in England -- among other things, his vegetarianism restricted what he could eat. He sailed back to India in 1919 and tragically died at the age of 32.

Ramanujan was truly ahead of his time, having jotted down truly extraordinary mathematical formulas and observations in his notebook, such as the following formula for pi: \[\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{99^2}\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(4k)!}{k!^4}\frac{26390k+1103}{396^{4k}}.\]
Another piece of trivia: the \(n^{\text{th}}\) \(\textbf{taxicab number}\), or the smallest integer that can be expressed as the sum of two positive integer cubes in $n$ distinct ways, arises from a famous anecdote that perfectly illustrates the innate mathematical genius of Ramanujan:

<em>I remember once going to see him [Ramanujan] when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi-cab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to be rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two [positive] cubes in two different ways.  - G.H. Hardy</em>
	
(Indeed, the \(2^{\text{nd}}\) taxicab number, \(1729\), can be written as \(1^3+12^3\) or \(9^3+10^3\).)

Ramanujan's life is truly inspiring, and he serves as an illustration of the power of curiosity and mathematical intuition. Without further ado, let's dive into some of his discoveries!

\(\textbf{Problem:}\) We'll begin our exploration of Ramanujan's works with a few remarks on \(\textbf{Nested Radicals}\). Ramanujan is famous for his infinite sums, series, and fractions, and some of his favorite algebraic set-ups involved roots inside of other roots (inside of other roots...). We'll be focusing on an interesting \(\textit{infinite}\) nested radical. Ramanujan sent the following infinite nested radical to a mathematical journal in 1911 as a puzzle: \[\sqrt{1 + 2\sqrt{1 + 3\sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{\dots}}}} = ?\]
Give it a try before reading on!

\(\textbf{Discussion:}\) For those of you who have seen infinite expressions before, your first instinct might be to find the expression "within" itself. Indeed, this technique can be used to compute numerous simpler expressions, like \(\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{\dots}}}}\). (For those who haven't seen this, try setting \(S = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{\dots}}}}\); then \(S = \sqrt{1+S}\), and you can solve for \(S\).) However, that won't cut it here -- Ramanujan makes us work a bit harder. In order to calculate this nested radical, we need to make use of the following simple, yet crucial identity: \[(n+1)^2 = 1 + 2n + n^2 = 1 + n(n+2).\] Taking a square root, we see that \[n = \sqrt{1 + (n-1)(n+1)}.\] Alright, that's nice... we have a \(\sqrt{1+\text{something}}\), but we clearly need more than one radical! To start building up our infinite nested radical, let's apply our identity again, this time on \(n+1\): as \(n+1 = \sqrt{1+n(n+2)}\), we have \[n = \sqrt{1+(n-1)\sqrt{1+n(n+2)}}.\] Now that's starting to look more like it! Since we're gonna need that \((n-1)\) to the right of the first 1 to be 2, we should set \(n=3\): \[3 = \sqrt{1+2\sqrt{1+3\cdot 5}}.\] We can see where this is going; by using this identity repeatedly, we find \[3 = \sqrt{1 + 2\sqrt{1 + 3\cdot 5}} = \sqrt{1 + 2\sqrt{1 + 3\sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{\dots}}}}.\] But that's our infinite nested radical! It follows that the answer to our puzzle is simply \(\boxed{3}\).

It might take some time to digest that dose of mathematical magic, but once you get it, you'll understand its beauty. Once you get it, you can also hone your Ramanujan problem-solving skills on the following exercises.

\(\textbf{Exercise 1:}\) What is the value of \(\sqrt{1 + 3\sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{1 + 5\sqrt{\dots}}}}\)? How about \(\sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{1 + 5\sqrt{1 + 6\sqrt{\dots}}}}\)? Generalize and prove your observations.

\(\textbf{Exercise 2:}\) Try modifying the above solution to compute another one of Ramanujan's infinite nested radicals: \[\sqrt{6 + 2\sqrt{7 + 3\sqrt{8 + 4\sqrt{\dots}}}} = ?\] Can you generate more such identities?

\(\textbf{Exercise 3:}\) Those of you who know/are learning calculus, take a stab at the following analysis question: when does the infinite nested radical \(\sqrt{a_1 + b_1\sqrt{a_2 + b_2\sqrt{a_3 + b_3\sqrt{\dots}}}}\) converge?

\(\textbf{Exercise 4:}\) In the above post, we hinted at how to calculuate... Let's take this one step further, by introducing the following \(\textbf{infinite continued fraction}\): \[1+{1\over 1+{1\over 1+{1\over 1+...}}}.\] Find its value, and compare your answer to \(\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{\ldots}}}}\). Any observations?

That's it for this post! Feel free to write to us (sunjos20@bergen.org and sampai20@bergen.org) with any questions, comments, or topic requests. Next post, we'll be discussing some of Ramanujan's results at the intersection of elementary algebra and number theory: on composing cubic forms. As a teaser, give the following problem a try.

\(\textbf{Exercise 5:}\) Find a 9-tuple of positive integers \((a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i)\) satisfying \[(a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc)(d^3+e^3+f^3-3def)=g^3+h^3+i^3-3ghi.\] Can you find any with \(a, b, c\) distinct? (Feel free to use a computer program.)
