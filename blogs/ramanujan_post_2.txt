Hey everyone, welcome back to the second installment of our \(\textbf{Great Mathematicians}\) series. We'll be continuing with the works of Ramanujan, and the theme for today is \(\textbf{Composing Cubic Forms}\).

For ages, mathematicians have asked the question: "if I multiply two 'forms' together, is it possible for me to get the same 'form'?" When we say "form" in this context, we mean an algebraic expression of a fixed... well, form. As an illustrative example, suppose we consider the form \(x^2+y^2\) (a "sum of two squares"). A natural question arises: what happens when I multiply two such forms together? Will I always get \(\textit{another}\) sum of two squares? The answer is yes, and Diophantus first proved that \((a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2) = (ac+bd)^2 + (ad-bc)^2\). Euler provided a similar result for sums of four squares. Great mathematicians like Fermat, Lagrange, and Gauss have all toyed with more general versions of this problem, and modern day mathematicians like Manjul Bhargava continue to probe this fascinating field of number theory. Of course, Ramanujan played around with this question, taking it many steps further. His next, slightly bizarre result -- which, thankfully, simply requires algebra to prove -- gets us thinking about the following related question: what can we expect for the form \(x^3+y^3+z^3-3xyz\)? Can we say anything about multiplying two of those together?

\(\textbf{Theorem:}\) Let \(a = x^2+2yz\), \(b = y^2+2zx\), and \(c = z^2+2xy\). Then \[a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc = (x^3+y^3+z^3-3xyz)^2.\]

(Before reading our solution below, give the problem a try for yourself!)

\(\textbf{Discussion:}\) You \(\textit{could}\) bash it out, but we'd like to present a more slick approach, perhaps the one Ramanujan had in mind. (Unfortunately, Ramanujan often didn't write down his derivations.)
We'll make use of the following famous factorization: \[a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca).\] Note that this can be rewritten as \[a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc = \frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)((a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2).\] If you don't know the proof, see the exercises at the end of this section.
With this identity, the left-hand side becomes \[\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)((a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2) = \frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2+z^2+2xy+2yz+2zx)((a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2).\] We recognize the first term as \((x+y+z)^2\). As for the second term, let's take a look at one of its components, say \((a-b)^2\). The quantity \((a-b)\) factors as \[(x^2+2yz)-(y^2+2xz) = (x-y)(x+y-2z) = (x-y)((x-z) + (y-z)) = (x-y)(y-z)-(x-y)(z-x).\] Interesting, these \((x-y), (y-z), (z-x)\) terms seem to be coming up a lot... 
Let's hold that thought and look at the right-hand side. Directly from the identity, we know \[(x^3+y^3+z^3-3xyz)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}(x+y+z)((x-y)^2+(y-z)^2+(z-x)^2\right)^2,\] or equivalently, \[\frac{1}{4}(x+y+z)^2((x-y)^2+(y-z)^2+(z-x)^2)^2.\] But wait a second, our left-hand side looks \(\textit{really}\) similar: we can cancel out a factor of \(\frac{1}{4}(x+y+z)^2\)! It suffices to show that \[2((a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2) = ((x-y)^2+(y-z)^2+(z-x)^2)^2.\]
Well, that's nice... but we still have fourth degree polynomials to deal with! Let's make use of an observation we made before we got distracted with the right-hand side: the \((a-b), (b-c), (c-a)\) terms can be written neatly in terms of \((x-y), (y-z), (z-x)\). This motivates the following \(\textbf{change of variables}\): \(A = x-y, B = y-z, C = z-x\). Our expression for \((a-b)\) becomes \(a-b = AB-AC\).
we'll now make a simple, yet key observation that'll simplify things tremendously: notice that \(A+B+C = 0\). Therefore, \(A = -(B+C)\), and we can rewrite \((a-b)\) as \(a-b = A(B-C) = -(B+C)(B-C) = C^2-B^2\). Similar expressions follow for \((b-c), (c-a)\), and the statement we must show is equivalent to \[2\cdot((C^2-B^2)^2 + (A^2-C^2)^2 + (B^2-A^2)^2) = (A^2+B^2+C^2)^2.\]
This is certainly more manageable than what we started with (though the squares are a bit disorienting). At this point, we'll expand both sides, making use of \(\textbf{cyclic summation notation}\). Cyclic sums (of 3-variables) of the form \(\sum_{cyc} f(x,y,z)\) sum up the value of \(f\) as the three variables are rotated cyclically. In other words, \(\sum_{cyc} f(x,y,z) = f(x,y,z) + f(z,x,y) + f(y,z,x)\). As a concrete example, \(\sum_{cyc} x^2y = x^2y + y^2z + z^2x\): you cycle the variables through the 3 possibilities and sum them up. This might seem intimidating at first, but with practice, you'll find it wonderfully convenient in algebra. We'll drop the \(cyc\) subscript for notational convenience.
The left-hand side becomes \[2\cdot\sum(C^4-2B^2C^2+B^4) = 2\cdot(2\sum A^4 - 2\sum A^2B^2) = 4\sum A^4 - 4\sum A^2B^2.\] Making use of the identity \((d+e+f)^2 = d^2+e^2+f^2+2(de+ef+fe)\) (we're running out of common letters...), the right-hand side becomes \[\sum A^4 + 2\sum A^2B^2.\] Therefore, it suffices to show that \[4\sum A^4 - 4\sum A^2B^2 = \sum A^4 + 2\sum A^2B^2\]\[\iff \sum A^4 = 2\sum A^2B^2.\] Huh, that's quite simple! To finish this off, we'll make use of our key observation that \(A+B+C=0\). Squaring this, we find \(\sum A^2  = -2\sum AB\). Squaring \(\textit{this}\) and making use of the same \((d+e+f)^2\) expansion, we find \[\sum A^4 + 2\sum A^2B^2 = 4\cdot(\sum A^2B^2 + 2\sum(AB)(BC)).\] But wait a second: \(\sum (AB)(BC) = \sum AB^2C = ABC\cdot\sum A = ABC \cdot 0 = 0\)! Hence we find \[\sum A^4 + 2\sum A^2B^2 = 4\cdot\sum A^2B^2 \implies \sum A^4 = 2\sum A^2B^2,\] completing the proof at last!

\(\textbf{Reflection:}\) With that out of the way, let's take a step back to reflect. The algebra wasn't that crazy; yes, there were a few tricks we pulled here and there, but the wonder of this identity lies beyond these manipulations. It lies in the path Ramanujan took towards discovering this algebraic gem. Think about it: if you asked yourself (as we asked you in Exercise 5 of last post) "is it possible for two forms \(a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc\) and \(d^3+e^3+f^3-3def\) to multiply together to get a third form \(g^3+h^3+i^3-3ghi\)?", you'd most likely be stuck. You might stumble across a few trivial ones, but generating infinitely many nontrivial examples? The task seems horrendously complex, but Ramanujan somehow found a simple set of solutions through the substitution \(a=x^2+2yz\). Unfortunately, we'll never know what motivated this discovery, but we undoubtedly can appreciate Ramanujan's keen eye for algebraic identities.

For practice, try the following exercises.

\(\textbf{Exercise 1:}\) Show that \[a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-bc-ca) = \frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)((a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2).\]

(\(\textit{Hint:}\) Again, you can bash it, but consider the following factoring approach. For starters, when does the factor \((a-b)\) divide the 3-variable polynomial \(f(a,b,c)\)? Can you formulate a similar condition for when \((a+b+c)\) divides \(f(a,b,c)\)?)

\(\textbf{Exercise 2:}\) Derive one of Ramanujan's related algebraic musings: if \(a,b,c\) are defined as above, \(t = (x-y)(y-z)(z-x)\), and \(\theta = xy+yz+zx\), then we have \[t^2 = (\theta-a)(\theta-b)(\theta-c).\]

\(\textbf{Exercise 3:}\) Derive Diophantus' identity \((a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2) = (ac+bd)^2 + (ad-bc)^2\) using two simple tools: difference of squares and complex numbers. 

(\(\textit{Hint:}\) apply difference of squares to \(a^2+b^2\).)

\(\textbf{Exercise 4:}\) Can you derive a four square identity that corresponds to Diophantus' two square identity? In other words, can you write \((a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2)(e^2+f^2+g^2+h^2)\) as a sum of four integer squares for any \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h \in \mathbb{Z}\)?

(\(\textit{Hint:}\) if you're having trouble, google "Euler's four-square identity" and try to verify it yourself. How would you come up with it in the first place? If you get stuck, look up the identity's relation to \(\textbf{quaternions}\), or ask us.)

That's it for this time! Feel free to write to us (sunjos20@bergen.org and sampai20@bergen.org) with any questions, comments, or topic requests. Next post, we'll be talking about \(\pi\). The following exercise isn't exactly what we'll be discussing, but give it a try anyways (especially those of you in calculus).

\(\textbf{Exercise 5:}\) Prove the \(\textbf{Leibniz formula for \(\pi\)}\): \[\frac{\pi}{4} = 1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{9}-\ldots.\]
