            <p>
                Although the BCA Math Team is typically geared towards high school students,
                it has recently begun offering lecture series during the summer to help prepare
                rising high school freshmen and middle schoolers. This summer, four lecture series
                will be offered in Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Number Theory throughout August.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each lecture series will meet four times for 90 min via Zoom. Homework assignments
                and class materials will be managed on each series' respective Google Classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions or would like to join a lecture series, please contact
                <a href="mailto: joyren24@bergen.org">joyren24@bergen.org</a> and/or
                <a href="mailto: andche25@bergen.org">andche25@bergen.org</a>.

            <h4>Algebra - Andrea Chen, Sundays @ 3pm</h4>
            <p>In this course, we will discuss various topics in algebra and develop strategies to be used in solving
                high school math competition problems. Topics covered will include polynomials and Vieta's formulas,
                sequences and series, trigonometric identities and their applications, and techniques to recognize and
                solve problems faster.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Dates:</b> August 6, 13, 20, 27
            </p>
            <h4>Combinatorics - Joy Ren, Sundays @ 10am</h4>
            <p>This course will cover various combinatorics topics ranging from the basics of counting to combinations
                and probability. We will go over interesting techniques such as PIE, challenging problems dealing with
                symmetry and distinguishability, and techniques to simplify complicated problems or exploit patterns in
                problems.

            </p>

            <h4>Geometry - Krish Ramkumar, Mondays @ 10am</h4>
            <p>In this course, we will go through many topics in geometry for mathematics competitions. Topics covered
                will include triangle congruence &amp; similarity, right triangles (the Pythagorean Theorem) &amp;
                special triangles, circles (and angle chasing), and special triangle lines/centers. We will also discuss
                strategies to solve contest problems quickly and efficiently.

            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Dates:</b> August 7, 14, 21, and 28
            </p>
            <h4>Number Theory - Justin Zhang, Saturdays @ 10am</h4>
            <p>In this course, we will walk through many fundamental topics in Number Theory and how to apply them to
                contest problems. Topics covered include bases, divisor problems/Euclidean Algorithm, modular
                arithmetic, and solving linear congruences/Chinese Remainder Theorem. We will start from the fundamental
                theory and progress to applying the concepts to AMC 10 level problems.
