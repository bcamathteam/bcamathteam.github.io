Anyone from any grade with any interest and at any level of math knowledge is welcome to join if you have interest in math competition.  Saturdays will tend to be a combination of lectures, actual competitions and practice competitions. In addition, I'm offering an elective on math team Mondays and Thursdays mods 25-27 for freshmen and sophomores.  This will be geared towards math competition as well.  If you have any questions, you can e-mail me at <a href=\"mailto:micabra@bergen.org\">micabra@bergen.org</a> or Mr. Pinyan at <a href=\"mailto:jonpin@bergen.org\">jonpin@bergen.org</a>."
