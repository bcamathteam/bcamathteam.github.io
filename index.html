                Registration for students in grades 9-12 is now open.
                Non-BCA students who attend school in Northern New Jersey are eligible to join our team; 
                if your school is outside a reasonable definition of "Northern New Jersey", please 
                <a href="mailto:jonpin@bergen.org">contact Mr. Pinyan</a> before registering. 
                Students who are not yet in grade 9 should not register at this time; 
                our coaches will directly invite a small number of younger students, as this is a challenging competition.
                <br>
                <br>
                We will be away from the morning of Friday 6/2 until approximately 10pm on Saturday 6/3. 
                The cost for this trip is $250 per student; this covers transportation, lodging in the Penn State dorms, some meals, and the tournament itself.
