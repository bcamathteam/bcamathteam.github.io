                <p>
                    The <a href="https://bcts.bergen.org/index.php/bca-home">Bergen
                        County Academies</a> Math Team is one of
                    the strongest math teams in the nation (check Past Results
                    in the <a href="/news">News</a> page).
                    The team
                    participates in many math competitions during the year, both
                    locally and across the globe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Math Team is open to all middle and high school
                    students, regardless of mathematical ability.
                    <!-- For middle schoolers, we have the Junior Math Team, which meets every other Sunday. -->
                    For students in high school (and some advanced middle
                    schoolers), the Saturday Math Team meets
                    every Saturday for three hours. These meetings will consist
                    of a combination of lectures, actual competitions
                    and practice competitions. Information on upcoming meetings
                    can be found at <a href="updates">the updates page</a>,
                    and resources and recordings of previous lectures can be
                    found at <a href="archive">the archive page</a>.

                <p>
                    This year our lectures will follow two different tracks:
                    <br>
                    <b>The Introductory Track:</b> A track geared towards
                    beginners who wish to do well on early-mid AMC 10 (even if
                    you
                    have taken the summer lecture series course in the topic, we
                    still recommend you take the introductory track).
                    <br>
                    <b>The Intermediate Track:</b> A track geared towards
                    veterans who wish to do well on late AMCs and early AIME.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are allowed to switch tracks if the level is too easy or
                    too difficult for you. You are also allowed to follow
                    different tracks
                    for different topics. Each week, the lectures seek to
                    address a chosen topic at both an introductory and an
                    intermediate level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also responsible for organizing and running the

                                                coach of the AAST Math Team, and

                                                Hi! I'm a senior in AAST and
                                                I've been involved with the BCA
                                                Math Team since middle school.
                                                Despite not being very good at
                                                it, my favorite subject is
                                                probably combinatorics because
                                                of its clean strategies and cool
                                                applications. In my free time, I
                                                like listening to music, playing
                                                cards, singing, playing tennis,
                                                and reading. I'm excited for
                                                Math Team to run in person this
                                                year and to see lots of familiar
                                                and new faces!!

                                                year. I love physics, math, and

                                                a senior in AAST. I’ve been a
                                                part of Math Team since middle
                                                school and have met so many
                                                great people here. It’s an
                                                amazing environment not only to
                                                learn interesting math, but also
                                                to meet and bond with friends. I
                                                can’t believe it’s my last year!
                                                My favorite topics mainly lie
                                                outside of competition math, but
                                                I think combinatorics is the
                                                coolest within competition math.
                                                Apart from math, I enjoy singing
                                                (not with Yul), listening to
                                                music, trying to make music,
                                                taking walks (sometimes with
                                                Yul), and eating food (with
                                                Yul). I really miss the Math

                                                excited to meet and welcome you

                                                the math team. My favorite
                                                subject is combinatorics because
                                                it’s the most fun to think about
                                                and I can see a lot of it being
                                                used in real life. Aside from
                                                doing math, I enjoy singing (not
                                                with Alicia), going to the gym,
                                                taking walks (sometimes with
                                                Alicia), and eating good food
                                                (with Alicia)! I’m excited for
                                                this year’s math team and hope
                                                to see you all in person!

                                                senior at BCA. In 7th grade, I
                                                switched from attending Chinese
                                                school to attending BCA middle
                                                school math team, and have never
                                                looked back since. My favorite
                                                subject used to be geometry, but
                                                now I’m more ambivalent. Besides
                                                math and science, I also love
                                                history, and am part of the
                                                Model UN and debate teams at
                                                BCA. Outside of school, I also
                                                like reading, playing cards, and
                                                playing piano. Looking forward

                                                    in 7th grade and continued

                                                    since. My favorite part of

                                                    anything. Besides math, my

                                                    math, I also love baking

                                                    crocheting. I’m excited to

                                                    weekend. My favorite subject
                                                    is
                                                    probably combinatorics just
                                                    because the problems are
                                                    always
                                                    really fun to think about
                                                    and
                                                    solve. Other than doing
                                                    math, I
                                                    love reading, growing
                                                    plants,
                                                    eating sushi, and helping
                                                    others. I’m so excited for
                                                    math
                                                    team this year, and I can’t
                                                    wait
                                                    to meet everyone in person!!
