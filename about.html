            <h3>BCA Math Team</h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://bcts.bergen.org/index.php/bca-home">Bergen County Academies</a> Math Team is one of
                the strongest math teams in the nation (check Past Results in the <a href="/news.html">News</a> page).
                The team
                participates in many math competitions during the year, both locally and across the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Math Team is open to all middle and high school students, regardless of mathematical ability. For
                middle schoolers, we have the Junior Math Team, which meets every other Sunday. For students in high
                school (and some advanced middle schoolers), the Saturday Math Team meets roughly every other Saturday.
                These meetings will consist of a combination of lectures, actual competitions and practice competitions.
                A more detailed schedule can be found at <a href="schedule.html">the schedule page.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                We are also responsible for running the <strong>Joe Holbrook Memorial Math Competition</strong>, <em>the
                    largest middle
                    school math competition in Bergen County</em>. For more information, please visit its official
                website at <a href="https://holbrook.bergen.org">https://holbrook.bergen.org</a>.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                If you are currently a BCA freshman or sophomore, please consider the Math Team elective offered by Dr.
                Abramson (currently Mondays and Thursdays mods 25-27). This will be geared towards math competitions as
                well.
