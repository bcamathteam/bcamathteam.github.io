                                                Math Team since I was a freshman and have enjoyed both learning about
                                                and solving clever math problems as well as getting to know a bunch of
                                                amazing people! Though I've always liked math, Math Team has helped me
                                                explore an entirely new side of math that I hadn't known about before.
                                                See you soon!

                                                few years now. I enjoy working on problems with others and spending
                                                countless hours on them. Personally, some of my favourite topics in math
                                                are algebra and olympiad number theory. Outside of math, I like to
                                                travel and hang out with friends. I look forward to seeing everyone this

                                                Hi! My name is Gabriele, a junior in AAST. I first joined math team in
                                                freshman year and I started to love the beauty of clever observations in
                                                competition math. My favorite math competition related activity is group
                                                solving IMO problems! Outside of math, I enjoy physics, coding
                                                competitions, violin, and volleyball. I'm excited to see everyone learn
                                                cool math this year!

                                                year, and over the years, it has been really fun to do math with other

                                                favorites are olympiad geometry (not computational) and combinatorics!
                                                Besides math, I love a variety of music and also play the piano myself.
