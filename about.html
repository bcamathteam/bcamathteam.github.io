                                                subjects are combinatorics and number theory. Outside of

                                                I joined Math Team during my freshman year at BCA,
                                                and I've really enjoyed being a part of the awesome
                                                community. Math is a really intricate and diverse
                                                subject, and I hope we'll be able to explore a lot of it
                                                (not just competitive!) this school year.                                              Outside of math,
                                                I enjoy competitive programming and following the New York
                                                Yankees. Hope you enjoy Math Team!

                                                competitions for even longer. In the realm of math and
                                                math-related things, I really like geometry, number

                                                Hi! I'm a junior in ABF who dabble in middle
                                                school math team and continued with the BCA
                                                Math Team as a freshman. I believe strongly that
                                                math is for everyone, and a love of math can stem
                                                from anywhere. The BCA Math Team is a place for
                                                all types of people with all types of math. We
                                                hope to create a place to laern, make friends, and
                                                importantly have fun. My current favorite subjects
                                                are group theory and linear algebra, which are both
                                                very discrete and foundational but immensely beautiful
                                                and visual. Outside of school, I enjoy philosophy,
                                                badminton, and good music (Lance has better taste
                                                than me, though). I'm very excited to meet you all
                                                in-person this year!

                                                year. Other than math, I enjoy robotics, baking, and journaling.

                                                dance, and play the flute. But, most of all, I've always
                                                loved math! It wasn't until I joined Math Team during my
                                                freshman year at BCA, though, that I began to truly appreciate
                                                the beauty and complexity of the subject. Math Team is so much
                                                more than just contests and obscure theorems. It is an amazing
                                                community where we get to explore and appreciate math beyond
                                                the traditional lens and I strongly believe anyone can enjoy
                                                it. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there!
