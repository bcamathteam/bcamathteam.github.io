                    County Academies</a> Math Team is one of
                the strongest math teams in the nation (check Past
                Results
                in the <a href="/news">News</a> page).
                The team
                participates in many math competitions during the year,
                both
                locally and across the globe.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Math Team is open to all middle and high school
                students, regardless of mathematical ability.
                <!-- For middle schoolers, we have the Junior Math Team, which meets every other Sunday. -->
                For students in high school (and some advanced middle
                schoolers), the Saturday Math Team meets at BCA
                every Saturday for three hours (1-4 PM). These meetings will
                consist
                of a combination of lectures, actual competitions
                and practice competitions. Recordings of previous lectures can be

                                            participating in Math Team since middle school.
                                            Math Team has always been a special community
                                            for me where we can all gather together and learn
                                            about challenging and interesting topics. Besides
                                            math, I also love baking desserts, hiking, and hanging
                                            out with my bird. I'm excited to meet you all and work on

                                            school math team and continued with the BCA
                                            Math Team as a freshman. As of now I really enjoy abstract
                                            algebra and probability theory. Outside of math, I enjoy
                                            rock climbing, philosophical discussions, and good music!
                                            I believe strongly that math is for everyone, and a
                                            love of math can stem from anywhere.
                                            The BCA Math Team is a place for
                                            all types of people with all types of math. We

                                            Hey! I'm Riddhi, a senior in AEDT. I love to read,
                                            dance, and play the flute. But, most of all, I've always
                                            loved math! It wasn't until I joined Math Team during my
                                            freshman year at BCA, though, that I began to truly appreciate
                                            the beauty and complexity of the subject. Math Team is so much
                                            more than just contests and obscure theorems. It is an amazing
                                            community where we get to explore and appreciate math beyond
                                            the traditional lens and I strongly believe anyone can enjoy
                                            it. I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there!

                                            freshman and have enjoyed both learning about
                                            and solving clever math problems as well as getting
                                            to know a bunch of amazing people! Though I’ve
                                            always liked math, Math Team has helped me explore
                                            an entirely new side of math that I hadn’t known
                                            about before. See you soon!
